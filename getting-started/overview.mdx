# 🚀 Welcome to Gextron

Gextron is a **real-time options analytics and trading intelligence platform** designed for traders who want an edge in today’s fast-moving markets.  
Instead of relying only on price action, Gextron surfaces **option premium signals, market maker hedging pressure, and unusual order flow** so you can anticipate moves before they fully play out.

## Why Gextron?

Traditional charting tools stop at price and volume.  
Gextron goes deeper:

- **Key Levels** – Dynamic support/resistance levels (P-Trans, N-Trans, Gamma walls).
- **Price Targets** – Daily and weekly targets for entry/exit planning.
- **Option Flow** – See real-time unusual options activity (UOA) and bullish/bearish flow.
- **Tape Reading** – Live order flow streams for both equities and options.
- **News Integration** – Market and ticker-specific news directly in your dashboard.

> 📊 Gextron combines these signals into a unified dashboard, so you always know **where the market pressure points are**.

## Who is it for?

- **Retail traders** who want institutional-grade tools.
- **Options traders** looking for more than “gut feel.”
- **Swing & intraday traders** who need forward-looking levels, not just lagging indicators.
- **Professional analysts** who want fast, reliable data in one place.
