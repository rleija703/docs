- ðŸŽ¯ **Price Targets** â†’ Calculated for **every single expiration** using implied volatility, so you know realistic ranges by daily, weekly, monthly, or quarterly horizons.  
- ðŸ”„ **Option Flow** â†’ Tracks real-time unusual options activity (UOA) so you can see where large players are aggressively positioning.  
- ðŸ“ˆ **Tape Reading (Pro)** â†’ Real-time order tape for both equities and options, color-coded for instant context.
