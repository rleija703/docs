# ðŸŽ¯ Price Targets

Price Targets in Gextron give you **forward-looking levels** based on option premium flows.  
They help you plan **where the market is likely headed** instead of reacting to lagging signals.

## Why Price Targets Matter

- Provide **clear exit zones** for profitable trades  
- Help avoid **holding too long** after momentum fades  
- Act as checkpoints to evaluate whether to **scale in or take profit**  
- Align with institutional hedging mechanics

## Types of Price Targets

### ðŸ“† Daily Targets
- Updated every session  
- Useful for **intraday trades**  
- Often coincide with **intraday key levels**  

---

### ðŸ“† Weekly Targets
- Broader perspective  
- Ideal for **swing trades** or higher timeframes  
- Align with option expiration cycles  

---

## How to Apply Targets

1. **Set Profit Goals**  
   - Use the nearest target as your **first take-profit zone**.  
   - Stretch goals = the next higher/lower target.  

2. **Size Your Risk**  
   - If price is far from target, risk/reward may be poor.  
   - Best trades occur when **entry is near a level, with target close in range**.  

3. **Combine with Key Levels**  
   - Enter trades **near support/resistance**.  
   - Exit **at or near Price Targets** for maximum efficiency.

## Example Workflow

- SPY opens near support above P-Trans.  
- Daily Price Target = 525.  
- Trader enters long calls at 520.  
- Takes partial profit at 525, lets remainder run to weekly target at 532.
