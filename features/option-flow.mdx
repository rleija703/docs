# 🔄 Option Flow

Option Flow shows you **large, unusual transactions** in the options market. These flows help you see where aggressive buyers and sellers are positioning, often before the move happens.

<Callout type="info" title="Real-time & always seeking">
  Gextron’s Unusual Options feed **auto-updates in real time** and is **continuously scanning** for new prints. There’s no need to refresh; new orders stream in as they cross the tape.
</Callout>

  <img src="https://alfatoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/spy-unusual-option.png" alt="Unusual option flow" />
</Frame>

When you open the **Unusual Options** feed in Gextron, each row shows:  
- ⏱ **Time** of execution  
- 📄 **Contract details** (ticker, strike, expiration)  
- 📅 **Days to expiration (DTE)**  
- 💰 **Premium** of the transaction  
- 📈 **Spot price** of the underlying  
- ⚖️ **Moneyness** (ITM, ATM, OTM)  
- 🧾 **Order type** (Sweep or Block — or blank for large single prints)

## Sweep vs Block

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Sweep Orders">
    A **sweep** order is broken into smaller pieces and routed across multiple exchanges to **get filled quickly**.  
    • Indicates **urgency** — trader wants in fast.  
    • Seen as **more aggressive** than a block.  
    • Often predictive if repeated near key levels.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Block Orders">
    A **block** order is a single large trade, usually negotiated off-exchange between institutions.  
    • Less urgency than a sweep.  
    • Still important — shows **size positioning**, but may be part of a spread.  
    • If order type cell is empty in Gextron → it’s just a **large block**.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Color Coding in Gextron

Gextron color codes every transaction to make it easy to **see sentiment and aggressiveness**.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Text Colors">
    - **White text** → Neutral sentiment  
      • Could be noise or part of a spread.  
      • Still useful in sequence context.  

    - **Red text** → Bearish sentiment  
      • **Put** bought at the **ask** → bearish bet.  
      • **Call** sold at the **bid** → bearish exit.  

    - **Green text** → Bullish sentiment  
      • **Call** bought at the **ask** → bullish bet.  
      • **Put** sold at the **bid** → bullish exit.  
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Background Colors">
    - **Red background** → Aggressively bearish  
      • **Call** filled **below bid** = trader dumping bullish exposure.  
      • **Put** filled **above ask** = trader paying up for bearish exposure.  

    - **Green background** → Aggressively bullish  
      • **Call** filled **above ask** = trader paying up for bullish exposure.  
      • **Put** filled **below bid** = trader dumping bearish exposure.  
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Understanding Moneyness

**ITM (In the Money)** → Contracts already have intrinsic value. Safer, more expensive.  
**ATM (At the Money)** → Strike price ≈ underlying spot price. Most liquid, balanced risk/reward.  
**OTM (Out of the Money)** → Purely speculative. Cheap, but lower probability unless flow is very aggressive.  

Moneyness helps you filter **serious institutional bets** (ITM/ATM sweeps at size) vs **lottery tickets** (OTM noise).

## Filtering and Lookback

<Frame caption="Filtering unusual option premium greater than $10,000">
  <img src="https://alfatoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/unusual-option-flow-filtering.png" alt="Unusual option flow filtering" />
</Frame>

Gextron gives you flexibility to filter **only the flows that matter to you**.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Lookback window">
    You can go back up to the **last 5 previous trading days** of Unusual Option Orders.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Filter by premium">
    Only want to see **million-dollar orders**?  
    Use the **premium filter operators**:  
    - `>` greater than  
    - `>=` greater than or equal to  
    - `=` equal to  
    - `<` less than  
    - `<=` less than or equal to  

    Example: `>= 1000000` → only shows orders **$1M or bigger**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="tip">
Premium filtering lets you quickly isolate **institutional-size trades** and ignore small retail noise.
</Callout>

## Why Color + Context Matters

- **Green text on calls at the ask** → institutions betting bullish.  
- **Red text on puts at the ask** → institutions betting bearish.  
- **White text neutral** → may be spreads → don’t overreact.  
- **Background colors** show when traders are **paying up or dumping aggressively** beyond normal bid/ask.  

<Callout type="warning">
Never trade **color alone**. Always confirm with **P-Trans / N-Trans levels, MaxReward/MaxPaint, AOIs**, and the Tape.
</Callout>

## Example Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Watch first 15 minutes">
    Note if **sweeps** cluster at levels (above P-Trans or below N-Trans).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Filter by DTE">
    Focus on contracts with **2–3 weeks** to expiration (not zero-day noise).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use Premium Filters">
    Example: only show **orders >= $1,000,000** to focus on real institutional bets.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Color + Order Type">
    Combine **text + background + sweep/block** to gauge conviction.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm with Tape">
    If Tape shows large prints in the same direction, confidence increases.
  </Step>
</Steps>
