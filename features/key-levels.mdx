# 🔑 Key Levels

Key Levels are the foundation of the **Gextron trading framework**.  
They act as **dynamic support and resistance zones** that help you anticipate where the market is likely to pause, reverse, or accelerate.

---

## Why Key Levels Matter

In options-driven markets, price is influenced not just by buyers and sellers, but also by **market maker hedging activity**.  
Key Levels highlight where this activity creates **invisible walls of supply or demand**.

When you trade with Key Levels, you can:

- Identify **high-probability entry and exit zones**  
- Anticipate **reversal points** and avoid chasing moves  
- Manage risk more effectively by setting stops around key areas

## Types of Key Levels in Gextron

### 📍 P-Trans (Positive Transition Level)
- Acts as a **bullish trigger**.  
- When price holds above P-Trans, hedging pressure often supports further upside.  
- Traders look for **long entries** above this level.

---

### 📍 N-Trans (Negative Transition Level)
- Acts as a **bearish trigger**.  
- When price fails at or breaks below N-Trans, hedging flows may drive downside.  
- Traders look for **short entries or puts** below this level.

---

### 🧱 Gamma Walls
- Zones where large amounts of options contracts cluster.  
- These can act as **magnetic targets** (price moves toward them) or **barriers** (price stalls near them).  
- Example: a **large call wall** may cap upside, while a **large put wall** may create a floor.

---

### 📊 Support & Resistance Bands
- Automatically calculated based on option premium flows.  
- Update dynamically throughout the session.  
- Useful for short-term intraday trading.

## How to Use Key Levels

1. **Check levels before market open**  
   – Mark P-Trans, N-Trans, and major Gamma walls on your chart.  

2. **Build your bias**  
   – Above P-Trans = bullish bias.  
   – Below N-Trans = bearish bias.  

3. **Confirm with other signals**  
   – Use **Option Flow** and the **Tape** to see if large players are aligned with your bias.  

4. **Plan entries & exits**  
   – Enter trades when price approaches or confirms at a Key Level.  
   – Take profits at the next logical level or target zone.
