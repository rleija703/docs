# ðŸ“Š Tape Reading (Pro)

Tape Reading is a **Pro-only feature** in Gextron. It gives you a **real-time stream of every transaction**, so you can see how price reacts when it hits **P-Trans, N-Trans, MaxReward, MaxPaint, or AOIs**.

<Callout type="info" title="Real-time always on">
The **Tape is always streaming**. No refresh needed â€” every transaction is captured and displayed the instant it crosses.
</Callout>

## Color Coding in the Tape

The Tape uses the **exact same system** as Option Flow:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Text Colors">
    - **White text** â†’ Neutral (often spreads / noise).  
    - **Red text** â†’ Bearish:  
      â€¢ **Put** bought at ask  
      â€¢ **Call** sold at bid  
    - **Green text** â†’ Bullish:  
      â€¢ **Call** bought at ask  
      â€¢ **Put** sold at bid  
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Background Colors">
    - **Red background** â†’ Aggressively bearish  
      â€¢ **Call** filled below bid  
      â€¢ **Put** filled above ask  
    - **Green background** â†’ Aggressively bullish  
      â€¢ **Call** filled above ask  
      â€¢ **Put** filled below bid  
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="tip">
The Tape updates instantly â€” use **clusters of aggressive orders** at levels as confirmation.
</Callout>

## How to Use the Tape at Levels

<Steps>
  <Step title="Support reaction">
    If price taps a **support AOI** or **MaxPaint**, look for **green text / green background** activity (bullish orders confirming support).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Resistance reaction">
    If price approaches **MaxReward** or an overhead AOI, watch for **red text / red background** flows confirming resistance.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Trigger confirmation">
    When price **crosses P-Trans**, confirm with **bullish orders** hitting the Tape (calls at ask, puts sold at bid).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Failure confirmation">
    When price **loses N-Trans**, confirm with **bearish orders** (puts at ask, calls sold at bid).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Filtering the Tape

You can filter the Option Tape to isolate only the transactions that matter:  

- **Premium filter** â†’ e.g., `>= 1000000` shows only **$1M+ option trades**  
- **DTE filter** â†’ focus on contracts with **2â€“3 weeks to expiry** instead of noisy 0DTE  
- **Equity Tape** â†’ shows all equity prints (no premium filter, but color still applies)

<Callout type="success">
Filtering lets you **cut through noise** and see only the **institutional-sized, high-probability prints**.
</Callout>

## Example workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Mark levels">
    In the first 15 minutes, mark **P-Trans, N-Trans, AOIs, MaxReward, MaxPaint**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Watch the Tape at levels">
    As price reaches a level, look for Tape confirmation (**buyers at support, sellers at resistance**).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply filters">
    Narrow to **$1M+ premium orders** or **2â€“3 week DTE** for higher conviction.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Combine with Option Flow">
    If **both Flow + Tape agree** at a level, conviction is strongest.
  </Step>
</Steps>
