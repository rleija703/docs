# 🖇️ Tape Reading

The **Tape** (also called order flow) lets you see **trades as they happen**.  
It’s the heartbeat of the market — showing you **where real money is moving**.

---

## Why Tape Matters

- Exposes **large prints, blocks, and sweeps** in real time  
- Helps confirm whether **flow is translating into executed orders**  
- Gives you **precise timing** for entries and exits  
- Builds confidence when entering near Key Levels

## Tape Types in Gextron

### 📈 Equity Tape
- Shows **stock trades** (shares, not options)  
- Large prints = institutions moving size  
- Useful for confirming **support or resistance holds**  

---

### 📉 Option Tape
- Displays **contract-level trades**  
- Includes sweeps, blocks, and large prints  
- Shows exactly **where traders are placing their bets**  

---

## What to Watch

- **Sweeps** → urgency, directional conviction  
- **Blocks** → negotiated trades, often institutional  
- **Unusual size/volume** → outlier prints worth attention  

---

## Example Workflow

- SPX is at resistance (Gamma wall).  
- Option Flow shows call sweeps.  
- The **Tape confirms multiple large prints** hitting the ask.  
➡️ Trader enters long calls with higher conviction.
