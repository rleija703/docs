# ðŸ“‘ Contract Selection

Picking the right contract is just as important as picking the right direction.  
Hereâ€™s how to choose contracts when trading with Gextron.

---

## Expiration Dates
- For **monthly targets** â†’ choose contracts **45â€“60 days out**.  
- For **weekly setups** â†’ choose contracts with **2â€“3 weeks** until expiration.  
- For **day trades / scalps** â†’ use **0DTE or 1DTE contracts**, but size smaller.  

---

## Strike Price
- Favor **in-the-money (ITM)** contracts for higher probability and stability.  
- Typical range: **30â€“38 delta** for swing trades.  
- Go slightly out-of-the-money (OTM) only when momentum and flow are strong.  

---

## Volume & Open Interest
- Stick to contracts with **high liquidity** (tight spreads, strong volume).  
- Avoid illiquid strikes where slippage eats profits.  

---

## Example
- Market bias: bullish above P-Trans on QQQ.  
- Entry at support level with daily target overhead.  
- Select QQQ call option, **30 delta, 45 days to expiration**.
