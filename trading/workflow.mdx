# ðŸ“ˆ Trading Workflow

This workflow shows how to move from **market scan â†’ analysis â†’ trade execution** using Gextron.

---

## Step 1: Start with Key Levels
- Begin with **P-Trans / N-Trans** and Gamma walls on major tickers (SPX, QQQ, IWM).  
- These levels show where market maker hedging can shift the market.  
- Define your **bias**:
  - Above P-Trans â†’ bullish bias  
  - Below N-Trans â†’ bearish bias  

---

## Step 2: Cross-Check Price Targets
- Look at **daily and weekly targets** to plan exits in advance.  
- Daily targets = short-term intraday moves  
- Weekly targets = swing or multi-day setups  

---

## Step 3: Confirm with Option Flow
- Watch for **Unusual Options Activity (UOA)**.  
- Bullish sweeps near support = confirmation for long calls.  
- Bearish sweeps near resistance = confirmation for puts/shorts.  

---

## Step 4: Refine with the Tape
- The **Tape** shows actual orders hitting the market.  
- Use it to confirm conviction:
  - Sweeps & blocks hitting the ask = aggressive buying  
  - Large prints at support = defense holding  
  - Size hitting the bid = bearish pressure  

---

## Step 5: Execute & Manage
- Enter near **levels** with favorable risk/reward.  
- Scale out at **price targets**.  
- Move stops up as price works in your favor.
