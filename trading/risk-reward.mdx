# ⚖️ Risk & Reward

Successful trading isn’t about winning every trade — it’s about making sure your **wins are bigger than your losses**.  
Gextron makes this easier by giving you **objective levels and targets** to anchor your risk/reward (R:R) calculations.

---

## What is Risk/Reward?
- **Risk** = how much you’re willing to lose if the trade fails  
- **Reward** = your profit target if the trade works  
- Expressed as a ratio (e.g. **1:3 R:R** = risking $1 to potentially make $3)  

> 📊 Gextron traders aim for **minimum 1:3 R:R** on option trades.

---

## Using Gextron Levels for Risk
- Place stops **just beyond Key Levels** (P-Trans, N-Trans, or Gamma walls).  
- This ensures you’re out quickly if the market invalidates your setup.  
- Example: If you enter long above P-Trans, stop goes just below N-Trans.  

---

## Using Price Targets for Reward
- Set profit targets at **daily or weekly Price Targets**.  
- Scale out in zones where Gextron shows pressure (Gamma walls, resistance bands).  
- Let a portion run if higher targets are in play.  

---

## Example Trade
- SPX above P-Trans at 5200 → bullish bias  
- Daily Price Target = 5250  
- Risk = 20 points (stop at 5180)  
- Reward = 50 points (target 5250)  
- R:R = **1:2.5** → trade only makes sense if flow/tape are strongly bullish  

---

## Best Practices
- Never enter trades with less than **1:2 R:R**  
- Reduce position size instead of moving stops wider  
- Use Gextron’s **levels + targets + flow** together to validate setups

⚡ **Key Takeaway:** With Gextron, your edge comes from combining **defined risk** (levels) with **clear reward zones** (targets) so you only take trades where the math works in your favor.
