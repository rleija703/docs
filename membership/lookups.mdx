# ðŸª™ Lookup Credits

A **lookup** is counted each time you request data for a **ticker** inside Gextron.  
This could be loading **Key Levels**, **Price Targets**, **Option Flow**, or the **Tape** for that symbol.

## How Lookups Work

- When you **search or open a ticker**, it counts as **1 lookup**.  
- You get a **60-second grace period**: refreshing or reloading the same ticker within 60 seconds does **not** count as an additional lookup.  
- Switching to a different ticker, or coming back after the grace period, will count as a new lookup.  

> ðŸ’¡ Example: You open SPX at 10:01 â†’ thatâ€™s 1 lookup.  
> Refresh at 10:01:30 â†’ no new lookup.  
> Refresh again at 10:02:15 â†’ counts as another lookup.
